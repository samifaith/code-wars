// Array.diff
// Description:
// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

function array_diff(a, b) {
  return a.filter(function(x) { return b.indexOf(x) == -1; });
}


Test Cases:
try {
  array_diff([1], [1]);
} catch(error) {
  array_diff = arrayDiff;
}


Test.describe("Basic tests", function() {

    Test.assertDeepEquals(array_diff([1,2], [1]), [2], "a was [1,2], b was [1]");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(array_diff([1,2,2], [1]), [2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was [1]");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(array_diff([1,2,2], [2]), [1], "a was [1,2,2], b was [2]");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(array_diff([1,2,2], []), [1,2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was []");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(array_diff([], [1,2]), [], "a was [], b was [1,2]");
  });
});

Test.describe("Random tests", function() {
  const array_diff_sol = (a, b) => a.filter(e => !b.includes(e));
  const generateRandomInt = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
  let a, b, expected, aLength, bLength;
  for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    a = [];
    b = [];
    aLength = generateRandomInt(0,20);

    for (let j = 0; j < aLength; j++)
      a.push(generateRandomInt(0,40) - 20);
    b = Test.randomize(a).slice(0, generateRandomInt(0, aLength));
    expected = array_diff_sol(a,b);
    Test.it("Testing for arrayDiff([" + a + "],[" + b + "])", function() {

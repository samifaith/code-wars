// Find the Difference in Age between Oldest and Youngest Family Members
// Description:
// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living
// family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the
// difference between them.
// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order.
// The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed
// ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between
// the youngest and oldest age].

 let maxAge = Math.max.apply(null, ages)
 let minAge = Math.min.apply(null, ages)
 let diff = maxAge - minAge
 let newArr = [minAge, maxAge, diff]

 return newArr

<!-- //Create three boxes in your HTML / CSS
//Click on a box and have it rotate (45+ degrees each click)
//On the third click of each box change the color of the other two boxes
//On a click of a box, turn that box into a circle and have it move to the right
//Pseudo Code and Wireframes: Build a simple slot machine with minimum 5 items per reel
//and 3 reels - user should be able to bet min or max and have their total update
// aka how much money they have won or lost. Min bet does $5 and Max bet does $50.
//They should start with $1000. Matches of the three wheels = a win just like a
// normal slot machine and they win 10x their bet -->
